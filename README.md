# HUB-game
A pixel art hub with mini-games, hangout area with Discord Voice Chat integration (hopefully)

Layout for it:
 - PIXEL ART!
 - Rather large hub
 - Peer to Peer connection
 - Single/multi player Mini-games: like darts, Pac-man, tetris, pool, etc.
 - Discord Voice Chat for each dedicated room? Maybe just let people make their own servers?
 - Along the lines of games, maybe make big group games like, a RPG hunt that a party can go on
